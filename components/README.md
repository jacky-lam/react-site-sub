# components

This folder is to hold all UI react components only.

## Rule of folder

-   Components that will be used across multiple pages should sit under the
    `components` folder (e.g. `components/heading`).
-   Components that is only used for one specific page should sit under the
    relative `components/pageviews/x` folder (e.g. we may have a
    `PortfolioPlans` component that is only used in the homepage; in this case,
    this component should be put in
    `components/pageviews/homepage/portfolioplans`).
